# Comment from team members

## Sergey Arustamyan
In the beginning together with Besart we've planned the initial concept of the expense splitting app and I've sketched out mockups with user flow for it. Then since I wasn't so good at Android Coding in the beginning of CCL3 I was doing the android course and also preparing the usability test plan. While I was creating the usability test plan it was Besart who was warking on code and he was mainly working on UI. Then after Besart started to work with databases issues with gradle started to appear which I tried to resolve together with tutor. We managed to reslove the issues with gradle but there were still issues left related to libraries that were related to database. Since it was last day we could get a help of tutors and not manage to create the app we've planned before on our own until the deadline we've finally decided to create a note taking app instead which was much simpler to do. Since I've had experience of creating similar apps for the assignments of Mobile Coding class I've managed to create a note taking app until presentation and used apps that I've created before as a reference which helped me to do it so quickly.
